# Masakhane Meeting Notes: 04/06/2020

● Time: 19:00

● Number of Attendees: 19

● Notes taken by Jade Abbott and Lerato Louis

# Introduction/ Progress Update 

 Jade - Welcomes everyone to this weeks meeting, noticing a number of  new participants. 
She highlights Masakhane’s semi informal structure as well as the typical meeting format.
This week’s open floor will be slightly different, as someone has submitted a question to the groups GitHub (under meeting agenda) 
for all discuss.

 Broad overview - Masakhane has firstly opened up to a wider audience (not limiting itself to machine translation) and 
is in the process of figuring out how to incorporate all other NLP tasks.

 Second thing that happened is we reached 45 machine learning benchmarks for language pairs, and the goal is to reach higher benchmarks.
A suggested way to get involved, for new participants, is to run the notebook and see if they can’t build one for their language.

 In tandem to that, particularly for the paper Jade and Julia wrote for the EMNLP, they did an evaluation component where they looked at
the models they’ve trained over the last 6 months. One of their focuses was on gauging how these models 
(that were trained on more religious data), were performing in more real world contexts. Some of the data sets they  translated were: 

           COVID-19 survey

           Ted Talk data set

           A song data set of African songs (to see if there was an evaluation they could do there)
       
# Initiative/ Project updates

● David - As a quick update on the NER task, they’ve since created a schedule, goal and tentative timeline 
(Listed in the notes as: 
  - June 1 - June 30: Data Collection 
  - July 1 - July 31: NER Annotation for 50 - 100k tokens/ annotation quality verification 
  - Aug 1 - Aug 31: Training of NER models).
The idea is to have data collection from the 1st of June. Languages, such as Fon and Bambara, that don’t have news corporals, 
present data set creation challenges. For Fon, data collection is restricted to the JW300 series. Egyptian Arabic too, although 
they have extensive Wikipedia coverage. For Nigerian languages the target is creating datasets for 4 languages, 
namely: Igbo, Pidgin, Hausa and Yoruba. Sesotho also don’t have a news website but there are a number of viable datasets for it. 
Swahili still doesn’t have an NER task, despite having a large dataset. Catherine volunteers to help annotate Swahili. 
Jade asks David to include the NER tentative timeline on the Masakhane milestone Google Doc.

● Musi and Velemina -  Still have around 500 sentences of Damara. Still working with the JW 300 series and still manually 
tweaking the links. They’re also still collecting stories and traditional processes. On the technical side, some of the links 
that were scraped from the site weren’t working and Musi and Velemina have been editing those. 
The plan was to push to get a benchmark so they could start train the model. 
A second dataset is from the Lutheran Church hymns. Velemina has invited and and all who’d like to help manually scrape about 
100 songs with links (which don’t match what they have to scrape). 

● Timi - Song translation is at about 40 something pages of lyric translations. There’s a new Slack channel for it, 
that we’re invited to add more songs to. Jade intends to reach out to friends who are African song writers, to hear if 
they’d like to contribute to the translation of the lyrics to their songs.

● Julia - 700 sentences gathered within a week which enabled Jade and Julia to write a paper with an
empirical component beyond bleu scores.They used a model to try translate a COVID-19 survey, then post edited it and the 
same was done for the Ted Talk data.

● Ricky - Has been trying to work with his first benchmark on a language from Central Nigeria (Idoma) but he hasn’t been able to 
successfully run the colab for that language. It runs for Zulu and Igbo. The group mob debugged his code (using the opus.nlpl.eu), 
also suggesting these as references: (https://github.com/msquarme/Parallel-Corpus/blob/master/Scraping.py) and (https://www.jw.org/en/library/?contentLanguageFilter=bom)

# Project and Paper Updates

● Hady - Suggested a reading group day, where all the Masakhaneans who got accepted into WiNLP, present their work. 
It’d be cool to invite people and have each authors take about 10 min to go through their paper. 
This will help authors work on their tone and pitch.

# Other notes

● Links shared in the group: http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/ - specifically for Damara

● Link to Masakhane’s meeting agenda:  https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-meeting-agenda/

Then Jade and Lerato stopped taking notes, but if anyone can help expand these, that would be useful.
